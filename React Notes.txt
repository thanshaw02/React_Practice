React notes:
   - React component names MUST BE CAPITALIZED!
      - This seems to be the case for all React components that aren't the root React component
      - But I'm assuming even though lower case React root components work, we want to capitalize them anyways
   - Components
      - Small pieces of code that make up a reusable part of a web application
      - USUALLY need a root element in them, for example a <div/> or something to hold the React componants contents
         - OR an array of components can be used instead of a root element
            - Example:
               const Footer = () => {
                  return [
                     <h1>Greetings!</h1>,
                     <CustomComponent name="Tylor" age="25" />,
                     <Footer />
                  ]
               }
            - Returning an array of elements looks ugly though and can cause issues, instead we can use "fragments"
               - Fragments are empty HTML tags that are used to wrap multiple elements when not using a root element
               - Example:
                  const App = () => {
                     return (
                        <>
                           <h1>Greetings!</h1>
                           <CustomComponent name="Tylor" age="26" />
                           <Footer />
                        </>
                     )
                  }
      - Example:
          const Hello = () => {
            return (
              <div>
                <p>The variable 'Hello' is a React component!</p>
              </div>
            )
          }
   - Properties (props)
      - Passing data to components is know as passing a 'prop'
      - So any data passed to a component is a 'prop'
      - Example:
          const Hello = (props) => {
            return (
              <div>
                <p>Printing out the 'props' passed to this component: {props.name}!</p> // Here I'm using the name of the data passed (name) and displaying it
              </div>
            )
          }
          const App = () => {
            return (
              <div>
                <p>Greetings!</p>
                <Hello name="Tylor" /> // Here I'm calling the data passed to the React componant 'name'
              </div>
            )
          }
   - State
      - It is FORBIDDEN in React to update states directly, so you CAN do it but you SHOULDN'T!
      - Add more if needed, I kind of forgot to take notes here since I was coding lol..
   - Hooks
      - Do NOT call the "useState()" function from inside of a loop, a conditional expression, or any place that is not a function defining component

Conventions:
   - Using a root React component called 'App' that ties all other components together
   - ADD MORE AS THEY COME!!
